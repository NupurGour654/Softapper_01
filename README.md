SoftApperTechSolutions Task 01:
**Rock-Paper-Scissors in Python**

This repository contains a Python program that implements the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. You can challenge the computer to a game and test your luck (or strategic prowess)!

**Features**

* Simple and intuitive gameplay
* Clear user prompts and informative messages
* Tracks wins, losses, and ties for the entire game session

**How to Play**

1. The program will display instructions and prompt you to choose your move: Rock (rock), Paper (paper), or Scissors (scissors),invalid for others.
2. Enter your choice (case-insensitivbvhjgiuupi
3. The computer will randomly generate its move.
4. The program will determine the winner and display the results:
   - You win
   - You lose
   - It's a tie

**Gameplay Loop**

The program will continue prompting you to play again until you choose to quit.

**Contribution**

Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests! Here are some potential areas for extension:
* Add difficulty levels with the computer making more strategic choices.
* Keep track of win/loss/tie statistics across multiple games using data persistence (e.g., files).
* Allow for two-player mode for human vs. human competition.

I hope this README page helps you get started with this Python implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors!
